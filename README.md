# Tic-tac-a-go
My own tic tac toe game, made just for fun, has evolved.

This (almost) purely cpp terminal game is my tasteful version of tic-tac-toe that allows the board to have a board size of up to 50 * 50 and a win condition of up to 10 tokens (x or o's) in a line. 

To play, run the ticGame.sh executable in your terminal and the program will be compiled automatically and start running. 

First functional, then optimised. 

Currently only supports human multiplayer capabilities. 

To be implemented:
    more than 2 multiplayer option
    dump random playing computer option
    smarter AI implementation
