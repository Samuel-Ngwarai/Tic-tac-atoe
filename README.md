# Tic-tac-a-go

Just like tic-tac-toe, but not limited to 3 x 3 boards!

This (almost) purely cpp terminal game is my tasteful version of tic-tac-toe that allows the board to have a board size of up to 50 * 50 and a win condition of up to 10 tokens (x or o's) in a line. Horizontal, Vertical or Diagonal. Uses BFS for condition-check. 

To play, download files and run ./ticGame.sh in your terminal and the program will be automatically compiled and started.
